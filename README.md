# ecore-typescript

CrossEcore is a framework for model-based software engineering targeting multiple platforms.
From a platform-independent class model (i.e. an Ecore model), source code for multiple platforms like C#, TypeScript, JavaScript and Swift is generated.
Derived attributes, constraints for model validation and operation bodies can be expressed in the [Object Constraint Language (OCL)](http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/About-OCL/).
CrossEcore comes with a runtime library for every target platform that implements the Ecore and OCL API.
The Ecore API provides many of the features that are known from the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/), e.g., persistence, reflection, notifications, switches, factories, referential integrity and validation.
With the aid of an OCL Compiler, OCL expressions are translated to equivalent expressions of the target programming language.
CrossEcoreâ€™s APIs can be used across platforms almost consistently.

This package implements the Ecore and OCL API in TypeScript/JavaScript.
You need this package (1) when you have generated TypeScript/JavaScript code from your own custom Ecore model as it depends on this package or (2) when you want to create Ecore models programmatically.

Java developers that are familiar with the Eclipse Modeling Framework will note that this package corresponds to the original Java package org.eclipse.emf.ecore.


# Tutorial
An example how CrossEcore TypeScript can be used in an Angular app for web browsers and in a Tabris (Cordova) app for Android can be seen in the [EclipseCon Europe 2018 tutorial](https://github.com/crossecore/examples-eclipsecon2018) which is also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7-ExsSzSWw).
